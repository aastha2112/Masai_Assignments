### Level: Level 1 - Easy

### Time to Solve the Problem: 5 Mins

### Problem Description

You are given two numbers representing `distance` and `time`. You need to calculate the `speed` using the formula `speed = distance/time` and determine whether to apply brakes or keep going based on the speed.

### Input

**Input Format:**
The first line contains two space-separated integers representing the distance travelled by car and the time taken to cover that distance.

**Constraints:**

- Distance < 1000
- Time taken < 5

### Output

**Output Format:**
Print "Apply Brake" if the speed is greater than 40, otherwise print "Keep Going".

### Sample Input 1

```
100 2
```

### Sample Output 1

```
Apply Brake
```


Solution:

Input : num1, num2
Begin
    set distance to num1
    set time to num2
    set speed = distance / time
    if  speed > 40 then 
        print 'Apply Brake'
    else 
        print 'Keep Going'
End
